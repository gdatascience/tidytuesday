# Product Overview

This is a TidyTuesday project repository containing weekly data visualization exercises and explorations. TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project in the R community where participants explore datasets, create visualizations, and share their work.

The repository contains individual analysis files for each week's challenge, spanning from 2018 to 2026. Each analysis typically includes data loading, wrangling, visualization, and image export. The project focuses on practicing R data science skills, particularly using the tidyverse ecosystem for data manipulation and ggplot2 for visualization.

Some analyses also include specialized visualizations using the gt package for creating publication-quality tables with images and custom styling.
